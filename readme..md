Welcome to the Java OOP Tutorial repository! This project is designed to help beginners understand Java and the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through practical examples and exercises.

What Youâ€™ll Learn

This repository covers the following core OOP concepts in Java:

Encapsulation: Protecting data using private fields and public getters/setters.

Inheritance: Reusing and extending functionality from existing classes.

Polymorphism: Using a single interface or superclass to represent multiple types.

Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by modeling them with abstract classes and interfaces.

Each concept is illustrated with clear, simple examples that you can run and modify.
